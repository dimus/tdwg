# Connecting taxonomic backbones with Global Names Tools

Biodiversity taxonomy provides means to organize information about living
organisms into maintainable tree- or graph-like structures (taxonomic
backbones). Taxonomy is tightly bound to biodiversity nomenclature -- a
collection of recommendations, rules and conventions for naming living
organisms. Species are often considered to be the most important unit of
taxonomy structures. To keep scientific names of species and other taxa
accurate and up to date are major challenges during creation and maintaining
large taxonomic backbones.

Global Names Architecture is an initiative that developed tools and databases
for detecting, parsing, and verification of scientific names. Verification
tools also provide an information which taxonomic and nomenclatural resources
contain information about a scientific name. Taxonomic intelligence provided
by taxonomic resources aggregated by Global Names allows to match taxons from
different backbones together, even if their "current" scientific names vary.

Parsing of scientific names with GNparser allows to normalize them, make them
comparable. Fast name matching (reconciliation) and finding of a taxonomic
meaning (resolution) by GNverifier allows to connect information from various
resources. Latest development of tools by Global Names allows to do
name-verification and taxon-matching on an unprecendented scale.
