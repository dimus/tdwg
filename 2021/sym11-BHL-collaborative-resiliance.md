Biodiversity Heritage Library and Global Names initiative: successes and the challenges for the future collaboration.

Biodiversity Heritage Libaray (BHL) is a major aggregation of biodiversity
literature with more than 200 thousands volumes. Globa Names initiative (GN)
stives to develop and provide tools for finding, parsing and verification of
scientific names. GN and BHL enjoy 10 years of collaboration in creation of
scientifc names index for BHL. Such index provides researches means of finding
data about more than a million species.

Recently BHL an GN developed a workflow that allows to traverse more than 5
million pages of BHL, finding and verifying scientific names in less than a
day. The unprecedented speed of the index creation opens an opportunity to
dramatically increase its quality and reach. The following challenges can be
now addressed.

1. Abbreviated names reconciliation

From 20% to 25% of all scientific names in BHL are abbreviated names. It is
much harder to reconcile and verify abbreviated names, because their specidic
epithets are not unique. We plan to solve reconcile the vast majority of such
names via statistical approach.

2. Linking of biodiversity publication titles with actual pages in BHL.

It is very important to connect literature aggregated in BHL with references
about species description and usage.

3. Using taxonomic intelligence for finding information about species.

Nomenclatural name for a species often changes with time. It is important to
be able to find information about a taxon even if its name is different now.

4. Finding information about original descriptions of genera and species.

5. Detection of species names inspite of "incorrect" capitalization.

Previously, or in hortycultural sources, specific epithets are often
capitalized. We need to build a system that is able to detect such names
reliably.

6. Removal of false positives.

Texts in Latin, names of people, geographical entities often create false
positives, that look like scientific names. Using machine learning techniques
will allow to get rid of most of them.

7. Detection of scientists and geographical entities in texts.
